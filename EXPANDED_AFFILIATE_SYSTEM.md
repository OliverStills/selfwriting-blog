# 🎯 Expanded Affiliate Product System

## What's New

Instead of just **3 books** per post, you now get **6-8 diverse Amazon products** including:

### Product Categories:
- **📚 Books** (2-3): Self-development, psychology, career
- **📓 Journals & Planners**: Track progress and reflect
- **💊 Supplements**: Mental clarity, energy, sleep support
- **🏋️ Fitness Equipment**: Build physical discipline
- **📱 Tech & Apps**: Productivity tools and devices
- **🔧 Tools & Gear**: Practical implements for action

## Why This Is Better
