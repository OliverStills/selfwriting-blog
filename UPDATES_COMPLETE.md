## ✅ Update 2: Framework-Based AI Prompt

### NEW: Framework Requirements
The AI now MUST incorporate evidence-based frameworks and explain HOW they work:

**STILL Phase Frameworks:**
- Stoicism (dichotomy of control, amor fati)
- Self-Compassion (Kristin Neff)
- CBT Cognitive Distortions
- Polyvagal Theory (nervous system states)
- Attachment Theory

**GRIT Phase Frameworks:**
- Behavioral Activation (action before feeling)
- Habit Loop (Cue-Routine-Reward)
- Exposure Therapy
- Dopamine Baseline Science
- Energy Envelope Theory

**REFLECTION Phase Frameworks:**
- Narrative Therapy (re-authoring)
- Growth Mindset
- Developmental Psychology
- Identity Foreclosure
- Values Clarification (ACT)

**ASCEND Phase Frameworks:**
- Skill Acquisition Research
- Leverage Principles
- Career Construction Theory
- Compounding Returns

### NEW: Phase-Appropriate Goals
```
STILL: "Get through today without making it worse" (not "optimize")
GRIT: "Do the thing X days in a row" (not "feel motivated")
REFLECTION: "Understand why I'm here" (not "take big action")
ASCEND: "Execute on clarity I've built" (not "still processing")
```

### NEW: Structure Requirements
```
1. Start with emotional hook (specific scene)
2. NAME what's happening (using frameworks)
3. EXPLAIN the framework (plain language)
4. Show HOW it addresses this exact problem
5. Give 3-5 tactical steps (phase-appropriate)
```
